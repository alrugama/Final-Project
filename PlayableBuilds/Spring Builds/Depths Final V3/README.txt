Hello and welcome! This document contains the controls necessary for you to play our game Depths. In this game, you play as an ex-convict who one day escaped the penitentiary. While he was imprisoned there, he was used as a test subject for countless experiements. After some time, he ended up apart of a successful trial run which successfully gave him imortality. The scientists thought him dead, and had him thrown out along with all the other failures. Unbeknownst to them, he had resurrected and managed to be the only prisoner to escape Penitentiary 13. 

Now decades later, after making a name for himself as the Undying, he has come back to this prison in search of the method to restore his humanity and to seek that sweet release of death he had long been searching for. All his relatives and friends have all long since passed, and he wishes to join them. However, since his descent into the prison, the inhabitants and the gaurds have all become mutated. What had happened there since the Undying first left? Will he find the method to restore his humanity? What depths will he need to go through to finally die?
